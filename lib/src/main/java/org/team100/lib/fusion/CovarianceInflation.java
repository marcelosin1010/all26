/**
 * Covariance Inflation
 * 
 * Result variance is inverse variance weighting, with two terms for covariance
 * inflation:
 * 
 * * mean dispersion weight: reduce the influence of mean dispersion, but not to
 * zero. My eyeball-tuned value for vision updates is 0.02, i.e. 2% mean
 * dispersion to maintain responsiveness to real changes without paying too much
 * attention to noise.
 * 
 * * minimum state variance: avoid state variance collapse. My eyeball-tuned
 * value for vision updates is 9e-6, or a stddev of 0.003, i.e. state confidence
 * of a few millimeters. This seems to keep it from becoming too confident and
 * locking in on the wrong value.
 * 
 * 
 * I tuned these terms by eye, in this sheet:
 * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmHL1UDd6vngmr-5_9fNHg2xLC4TEVWTN2nHZBOnje0/edit?gid=1604242948#gid=1604242948
